# Collisions
## Collision detections
> Collisions are calculate only when a part is in movement. 

### Pre-detection
For collisions, every individual object contain hitBox (and multiple hitbox for big object like walls, So they can be divided by rooms)
For detect potential collisions, we use Box/Box collisions (inspired by [Rectangle/Rectangle](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/rect-rect.php))

### Final collisions detections
When Two hitbox are collided, we calculate true collisions with Model/Model collisions (inspired by [Polygone/Polygone](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/poly-poly.php))

## Bounce
If a collision was detected, move is canceled and new position target are calculated from the movement of two model.

### Vertex direction calculate
We calculate the angle and the force of collision with the move vector of the vertex and calcul the angle with le diff√©rence beetween the face collided's normal and vertex vector <br>
Bounce of surface can be calculate from angle and surface material's bounce value.<br>
